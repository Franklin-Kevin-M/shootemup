# shootemup

Shootemup is a defender style game.  Its written in python, you will need to install python 3.6 or later (default is 3.10). 

## Installation

You must have at least Python 3.6

After python is installed you will need to install pygame.  In linux this is done via the following

Download the app from github.

Click the "code" button above and download the zip file.  Or however you go about getting apps from github.  Once files are extracted to a directory start a command prompt and cd into the directory where the .py files are located.  Then launch the game as detailed in the usage section.

Important the resources directory must be a subdirectory to where you launch the application since I use relative path/file references.
